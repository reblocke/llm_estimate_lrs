    "    lr_prompt = \"\"\"You are an expert in medical diagnosis who is giving assessments of how important a piece of information is when determining whether a patient has a particularly condition. Your task is to estimate the likelihood ratio of a finding for a disease. Recall that the likelihood ratio represents how much the ratio between the odds of disease given a result for a lab value, whether a physical exam finding is present, or whether a comorbidity is present over the odds of disease when you did not know the result.\n",
    "You will receive inputs in the following format; Target condition: <Condition, e.g. Cardiac chest pain>. Finding: <piece of information, e.g. ‘No radiation to the neck, arm, or jaw’>.\n",
    "So, for example. If the odds of a Condition Z being present was 1 (meaning 50% probability) before we knew anything, but then we got a result (Finding A) it became 2 (meaning 2:1 odds or 66% probability), then the likelihood ratio would be 2. \n",
    "Given a condition and a finding, you will provide your best estimate of the likelihood ratio as a floating point number. Return your answer in valid JSON with the following schema: { 'value': <floating point number greater than 0> }.\\n\\n\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, stronger evidence in favor of a condition has a value farther above 1. Strong evidence against a diagnosis has a value farther below 1 (closer to 0). A likelihood ratio of 10 is equally strong evidence for a condition as a likelihood ratio of 0.1 is against it. Likelihood ratios near 1 represent weak evidence for or against. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how I would like you to approach the problem:\n",
    "First, consider the condition you are predicting (Condition: ___). Is the condition a medical diagnosis? If so, what kind of findings are usually present in someone who has that condition. Does the condition specify a certain type of patient? If so, how does that change things? \n",
    "Then, consider the finding. If a finding is much more common among patients who have the condition of interest than among patients who do not have the condition of interest, then the likelihood ratio should be high. This might be because the finding is a consequence of the disease, indicates that an enabling condition is present, indicates that a frequently comorbid condition is present, or is related to the pathology of the condition. In general, likelihood ratios over about 20 are pathognomonic, above 5 or so is extremely strong evidence in favor, above 2.5 or so is strong evidence, above 1.4 is so-so evidence, and 1-1.4 is pretty weak evidence. Conversely, if the finding is more common in people who do NOT have the condition, then the likelihood ratio should be below 0. Similarly, a likelihood ratio below 0.05 would exclude the condition in most situations, below 0.2 would be extremely strong evidence against, below 0.4 would be strong evidence against, below 0.71 is so-so, and between 0.71 and 1 is pretty weak evidence against (meaning, it just doesn’t change the odds of the condition much). \n",
